# NeoVim configuration

## To-do's

- [ ] LSP
- [ ] Autocomplete
- [ ] Quickfix all LSP errors [trouble.nvim](https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim)
- [ ] LuaSnip

## Project search like Zed
- Copy the whole file content, but only show a subset where the search occured
- When saving, it saves the whole file, meaning that if you changed it somewhere else it will overwrite the whole file
